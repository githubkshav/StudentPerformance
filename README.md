# StudentPerformance
This repository is a notebook that takes a dataset based on predicting student performance and runs a logistic regression on it. Then, it attempts to satisfy the fairness criteria of independence, separation, and sufficiency, by auditing the machine learning model. Through this, it proves the mutual exclusivity of these criteria, and how you cannot audit this model to satisfy all three fairness criteria.
